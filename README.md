# comp310_proj4_teamG
Team G repo for comp310 project 4, Random Number Generator
IMPORTANT: Application is in the TeamG_Project4 folder!

Code for our python implementation of the Linear Congruential Generator for pseudorandom numbers can be found in the file "LCG_TeamG.py" in the "TeamG_Project4" folder.

Code for the virtual coloring book/canvas can be found in "Application_TeamG.py" for which we imported the algorithm we coded in "LCG_Team.py" and used tkinter to create a canvas for the user to use to create a picture that they can use 20 random colors for. Random colors are generated by clicking on the "new color" button.

The test file for the LCG file called "test.py" is within the actual repository itself.
